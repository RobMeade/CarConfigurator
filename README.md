# Car Configurator 

This project was created for demonstrative and educational purposes.  

The requirements for this project were to create a basic car configuration tool which would allow a user to;

- Select different car models
- Select colours for the selected model
- Add "extras" to the configured car
- Update the price to reflect the user's choices
- Provide an option to print the user's selection
- Run as a stand-alone executable
  
## Features
- Filtering of configuration options based upon item selection (models for specific manufacture, engines for specific model etc)
- Additional engine filtering options (fuel and gearbox type)
- Updating of configured options, prices, and total price
- Screen capture and automated save location opening
- Edge case protection (no items for selection, missing product images)

## Development

The project was created using Unreal Engine (5.0.3). it's code was written using C++.  The project makes use of Structs, Enums, TArrays, and User Widgets, to support both source and configurable data, and the user-interface.

## Further Development

Plans for further development include;

- Configurable categorised "extras" (e.g. in car entertainment, spare wheel, paint protection etc)
- Improved UI
- Support to email configurede car specifications
